# Approach Explanation: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Methodology (460 words)

Our persona-driven document intelligence system combines structural text analysis with semantic relevance ranking to extract the most valuable content for specific users and their tasks. The solution achieves high accuracy while maintaining CPU-only execution in under 60 seconds for document collections.

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline

We implement a dual-layer document processing approach that extracts both content and structure:

- **Primary Extraction**: PyMuPDF extracts text with font information, visual layout, and hierarchical relationships, capturing semantic structure.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: PyPDF2 provides reliable text extraction when PyMuPDF encounters format-specific issues.
- **Structure Recognition**: Font size analysis, formatting patterns, and natural language heuristics identify section hierarchies (headers, subheaders, paragraphs).
- **Content Segmentation**: Multi-strategy paragraph boundary detection separates content into logically coherent blocks.

This approach preserves document structure while handling varied PDF formats, ensuring robust performance across diverse collections.

### 2. Persona-Centric Relevance Framework

To prioritize information based on user needs, we implemented:

- **Persona Profile Modeling**: The system analyzes the persona description to identify expertise level, domain knowledge, and task requirements.
- **Query Construction**: A specialized prompt combines persona attributes with job-to-be-done parameters to generate a comprehensive semantic query.
- **Contextual Weighting**: Task-specific elements receive higher importance based on the job description context.

This approach ensures that content relevance is determined by the specific user's perspective rather than generic importance.

### 3. Two-Stage Semantic Ranking

Our ranking algorithm employs a two-stage process for prioritizing content:

- **Stage 1: Section-Level Ranking**
  - All document sections are embedded using the sentence-transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
  - Cosine similarity between section embeddings and the persona-job query embedding determines initial relevance
  - Document diversity is ensured by limiting over-representation from single sources

- **Stage 2: Subsection Refinement**
  - Within each selected section, subsections undergo granular relevance scoring
  - Only the most pertinent subsections are retained to maximize information density
  - Fine-grained text segments are ranked according to their direct relevance to the task

### 4. Performance Optimization

To meet strict constraints (CPU-only, <1GB model, <60s runtime), we implemented:

- **Efficient Model Selection**: Using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (size ~120MB) provides a balance of accuracy and speed
- **Batched Processing**: Document embedding occurs in batches to optimize CPU utilization
- **Early Filtering**: Low-relevance sections are discarded early to reduce computational overhead
- **Caching Strategy**: Embeddings are cached to prevent redundant computation
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation at each processing stage ensures robustness

This approach consistently delivers relevant section extraction while maintaining performance within the specified constraints.
